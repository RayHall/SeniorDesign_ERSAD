Senior Design project for the Electrical Engineering program at the State University of NY at New Paltz

ERSAD is Emergency Response System and Drone. The system is designed for college campuses to allow students and faculty to immediately notify campus police of distress along with their location. The system also automatically programs a flight plan that allows an autonomous drone to fly to the distress location for the purposes of deterring or information gathering of a crime. 

The ERSAD uses 3 Raspberry Pi's running debian based linux operating systems, an Adafruit Ultimate GPS breakout board, lithium-ion polymer batteries, several LEDs and tactile switches, a PC computer, a 3DR Iris+ Drone with Pixhawk microcontroller and the school's existing WiFi network.

The ERSAD project was developed 
  By students:
    Christopher Brandt, Ray Hall, Walter Roosa and Alicia Scott
  
  Under advisment from: 
    Mr. Michael Otis, Computer Engineering Department
    Dr. Chirakkal Easwaran, Chairman of the Computer Science Department 
    
 All code was written by Ray Hall unless otherwise noted
